/* How This Works in Practice
1. A user logs in and gets a JWT token.
2. The user makes an API request and sends the token in the Authorization header.
3. Passport.js extracts the token, decodes it, and gets the user ID.
4. The function checks the database for the user.
5. If found, the user is authenticated and can access the resource.
6. If not, access is denied. */
